# UFOs

The purpose of this project was to create a web application that provides UFO data so that the user can conduct their own research. This web application has different functions, at the top of the page there is a navigation bar that the user can click to refresh the page, there is also a short article that exposes the question that humans have been asking for thousands of years "Are we alone in the universe?", at the bottom of the page there is a table with data on UFO sightings and a filters that you can use to narrow your search.
